# Javascript Code Activity

## Description

This project is a quiz about Javascript.  The user answers five multiple choice questions, and get assigned a score depending on how many questions they get right, and how much time they have remaining at the end of the quiz.  Each wrong answer incurs a 15 second penalty.  After completing the quiz, the user can add his initials to a score table, which is stored.

This project allowed me to practice working with Javascript logic, including timers and storing/retrieving data in localStorage.  I also improved my skills in DOM manipulation, as when I build up the high score list as a series of divs in Javascript.  Additionally, I learned to play audio files in Javascript.  The layout is based in Bootstrap, using the grid layout.  I used Bootstrap buttons and alerts as pre-defined components, and additional manual CSS to fine-tune the look of the page.
